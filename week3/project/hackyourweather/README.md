## Week3 - homework

**In this homework, There were no exercises except that there was a task to add some functionalities to Hackyourweather project, so for the weekly project:**

- I used the `filter` method to add the delete function on the app to delete the required list when I press on X button.
- When I search a city name it will add it to the previous search queries and keep showing on the screen.
- The input field does not accept to submit unless there is at least a letter in the search field.

_**Deployed App:**_
