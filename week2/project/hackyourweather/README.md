# Week2 - HomeWork

### In this homework, I created react exercises app with 3 exercises:

1.The first one is fetching a new friend from an API when we click NewFriend Button.
2.The second one is fetching a dog photo every time we click the button and it keeps adding the dogs' photos in an array.
3.Thirdly I used `useEffect` to make a side effect for a joke API when I fetch the Data from the API each time I click the button.

### For the weekly project:

from the point I stopped last week, Now I used openweathermap to fetch the weather data from it. I added a form to enter a city name and when you click the search button, the city data will be fetched and displayed.
